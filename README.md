# BLOCKCHAIN & CRYPTOCURRENCY

###### ======================================================

The scope of this project is to explore the emerging decentralized data-base structure of blockchain technology and the assets that build up from it, initially a crypto token. The project will display in a web-browser and interface a database developed in house.

## WHAT IS A BLOCKCHAIN?

###### ======================================================

### Blockchain

The blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger that stores data such as transactions, and that is publicly shared across all the nodes of its network.

A block is a storage unit, that has critical data, creation information and a hash value. Importantly each block also has a last hash property that is what connects it to the network, this last_hash key directly links it to the previous block on the network.

Another critical feature of the block is that it is referenced/acts as a ledger by recording contracts, payments, and asset allocation. The ledger is also distributed, meaning that it is shared by every node on the network which includes the entire/current working history of the ledger. This distributed ledger is what allows blockchain to be decentralized as it updates the whole network as transactions occur.

Using these concepts allows for a secure experience that is fair, democratized, and public. There is no point of central attention on the blockchain network so any illicit attempts at hacking, stealing, or bribing are significantly harder, if not impossible.

### Cryptocurrency

The most referenced use case of blockchain is a cryptocurrency which leverages the network but it truly is a digital medium of exchange. Crypto has three main concepts the Blockchain, wallets, and mining.

#### Blockchain

- Blockchain is used to keep a public database of transaction that is accessible by everyone. Cryptography is used to protect the network transactions to create signatures that uses a public and private key.

#### Wallets

- Wallets are objects that store the keypair, they can track how much currency is owned, what is owed to you, it also has unique address that is signed to you specifically.

#### Mining

- Mining does the work of adding transactions. As people submit transactions to the currency network the transaction joins the transaction pool. While in this pool the transfer is in an unconfirmed state, miners will take a number of unconfirmed transactions and use them as the data to be officially recorded by a block in the chain. To gain the rights to submit to the block, the miner must solve a computational puzzle called proof of work, the puzzle is difficult to solve and there is a low probability of solving this puzzle randomly so trial and error is required which is time consuming and computationally expensive. When the miner does solve the proof of work algorithm they can create a block consisting of the transactions gaining the rights to submit. Other miners will quickly verify the proof of work as the solutions is easily verifyable which finalizes the block and adds it to the chain. For the computational costs and energy requirements, the miner will receive an amount of the currency to pay for their efforts.
